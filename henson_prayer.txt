The Henson Prayer
(To be read in the voice of Kermit (or your favorite Muppet)) 

Our creator, who art in heaven,
Muppets be thy name,
Thy cable come, the show will be done,
On stage, as it is on television.
Give us this day, our daily laugh
And give us our puppets, as we convince those who do not understand. 
And lead us not into syndicate,
but deliver us from boredom,
for thine is the inspirational, celebrational and muppetational forever
Ah-YAAAYY!!!!

If you ARE the Muppets, we request a cameo so that we can be someone ;-)
